## Code Review Summary for Branch T2290725

### PASS/FAIL Decision
**Decision: PASS**

### Reasoning
The code changes introduced in this branch do not contain any critical issues that would prevent safe deployment. The new components are well-structured, the modifications to existing files improve functionality without introducing breaking changes, and thorough test coverage has been provided for both new and modified functionalities.

### Categorized Issues by Severity
#### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
- **None Found**

#### ðŸŸ¡ MAJOR
1. **Missing Tests for New Components**
   - **File**: `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner/LoadingSpinner.js`
   - **Issue**: While there are tests for the LoadingSpinner, additional scenarios could be covered, particularly around rendering issues and performance.
   - **Solution**: Consider adding tests that simulate rapid loading state changes to ensure the spinner behaves correctly under these conditions. E.g., test cases for multiple consecutive renders.

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - **File**: Documentation for the new `LoadingSpinner` and `formatCurrency` utility functions.
   - **Issue**: While there is a comprehensive overview in the documentation, adding inline comments directly in the code for clarity on the utility functions and component props would enhance maintainability.
   - **Solution**: Add JSDoc comments to the public API of the new components and utilities to clarify their expected behavior and parameters.

#### ðŸ”µ MINOR
1. **Code Style Consistency**
   - **File**: `src/utils/setTitle.js`
   - **Line**: 1
   - **Issue**: The formatting of the function could follow a consistent style with the rest of the project. Specifically, including a newline at the end of the file would adhere to best practices.
   - **Solution**: Add a newline at the end of the file to follow standard coding conventions.

### Specific Line Numbers and Code Snippets for Each Issue
1. **Missing Tests for New Components**
   - **File**: `src/tests/LoadingSpinner.test.js`
   - **Suggestion**: Consider adding tests for performance under various loading scenarios.

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - **File**: `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner/LoadingSpinner.js`
   - **Suggestion**: Add comments like:
     ```javascript
     /**
      * LoadingSpinner Component
      * @param {Object} props - Component properties
      * @param {string} [props.size='medium'] - Size of the spinner
      * @param {string} [props.color='blue'] - Color of the spinner
      */
     ```

3. **Code Style Consistency**
   - **File**: `src/utils/setTitle.js`
   - **Line**: 7
   - **Code Snippet**:
     ```javascript
     export const setTitle = (title) => {
       if (typeof title === 'string' && title.trim()) {
         document.title = `${title.trim()} - MegaMart`;
       } else {
         document.title = 'MegaMart - Your One-Stop Shop';
       }
     }; // Add newline here
     ```

### Actionable Solutions
1. **Add Missing Tests**: Create additional tests for performance and edge cases in `LoadingSpinner.test.js`.
2. **Enhance Documentation**: Add inline comments for clarity and JSDoc comments for the public API.
3. **Fix Code Style**: Add a newline at the end of `setTitle.js`.

### Priority Order for Fixing Issues
1. **Missing Tests**: High priority to ensure reliability and performance.
2. **Documentation Improvements**: Medium priority to enhance maintainability.
3. **Code Style Consistency**: Low priority but should be fixed for adherence to best practices.

Overall, this branch introduces valuable features and improvements to the project while maintaining a high standard of code quality. The recommendations provided will further enhance the codebase's reliability and maintainability.
