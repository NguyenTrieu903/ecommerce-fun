### Code Review Decision: **PASS**

#### Reasoning:
The changes introduced in the T2290725 branch do not exhibit any critical issues that would block safe deployment. The new components and utilities enhance the codebase without introducing breaking changes, critical bugs, or security vulnerabilities. While some areas could benefit from minor improvements and additional tests, these are not critical to the deployment.

### Categorized Issues by Severity:

#### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (FAIL if found):
- **No critical issues found.**

#### ðŸŸ¡ MAJOR (should fix before merge):
1. **Missing Tests for New Components**:
   - **Files**: `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner/LoadingSpinner.js`
   - **Issue**: While the `LoadingSpinner` component has a test file, the tests do not cover all edge cases, such as rendering with invalid props.
   - **Actionable Solution**: Extend the tests to include cases for invalid props, such as non-string or empty values for `size` and `color`. For example:
     ```javascript
     it('should handle invalid size prop gracefully', () => {
       const { getByRole } = render(<LoadingSpinner size={null} />);
       const spinner = getByRole('status');
       expect(spinner).toHaveClass('w-8 h-8'); // Defaults to medium size
     });
     ```

2. **Documentation**:
   - **Files**: `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner/LoadingSpinner.js`, `src/utils/formatCurrency.js`
   - **Issue**: While the code is relatively clear, adding JSDoc comments for public functions, especially the utility functions and component props, would enhance maintainability and clarity.
   - **Actionable Solution**: Add JSDoc comments for better documentation. Example:
     ```javascript
     /**
      * LoadingSpinner component to indicate loading state.
      * @param {Object} props - Props for the component.
      * @param {string} [props.size='medium'] - The size of the spinner.
      * @param {string} [props.color='blue'] - The color of the spinner.
      */
     const LoadingSpinner = ({ size = 'medium', color = 'blue' }) => { ... }
     ```

#### ðŸ”µ MINOR (can fix after merge):
1. **Code Style**:
   - **Files**: `src/utils/setTitle.js`
   - **Issue**: The function could benefit from minor refactoring to improve readability.
   - **Actionable Solution**: Consider using a ternary operator for cleaner code:
     ```javascript
     export const setTitle = (title) => {
       document.title = (typeof title === 'string' && title.trim())
         ? `${title.trim()} - MegaMart`
         : 'MegaMart - Your One-Stop Shop';
     };
     ```

### Specific Line Numbers and Code Snippets for Each Issue:

1. **Missing Tests for New Components**:
   - **File**: `src/tests/LoadingSpinner.test.js`
   - **Lines**: Add test cases to cover invalid props.

2. **Documentation**:
   - **File**: `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner/LoadingSpinner.js`, `src/utils/formatCurrency.js`
   - **Lines**: Add JSDoc comments at the beginning of the exported functions.

3. **Code Style**:
   - **File**: `src/utils/setTitle.js`
   - **Lines**: 1-5; consider using a ternary operator for improved readability.

### Priority Order for Fixing Issues:
1. **Missing Tests for New Components**: Ensuring comprehensive test coverage is crucial to avoid regressions.
2. **Documentation**: Improving documentation helps maintainability, especially for new components and utilities.
3. **Code Style**: Minor refactoring can improve readability but is the least urgent.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the branch introduces useful components and utilities without critical issues. The recommended improvements mainly focus on enhancing test coverage and documentation, which will further solidify the quality of the codebase.
