## Code Review Decision

**Decision**: **PASS**

### Reasoning
The code introduced in this branch does not contain any critical issues that would block safe deployment. While there are minor issues related to code quality and documentation, these do not impede functionality. The new components and utility functions are well-structured, follow best practices, and are accompanied by a thorough set of tests.

## Categorized Issues

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (FAIL if found)
- **None**

### ðŸŸ¡ Major Issues (should fix before merge)
1. **Missing Tests**: The `LoadingSpinner` component and its related logic have tests, but more edge cases could be considered. For example, testing how the spinner behaves when the size or color prop is not valid should be included.
   - **Line Reference**: In `src/tests/LoadingSpinner.test.js`, consider adding more tests for invalid prop values.

2. **Documentation**: While the new files are generally clear and follow conventions, the documentation could be improved to explain the components and utility functions.
   - **Line Reference**: In `src/utils/formatCurrency.js`, consider adding JSDoc-style comments to explain function parameters and return values.

### ðŸ”µ Minor Issues (can fix after merge)
1. **Code Style**: Minor formatting issues such as the lack of a newline at the end of files. While not critical, adhering to this convention improves readability.
   - **Example**: In `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner/LoadingSpinner.js` and `src/utils/formatCurrency.js`, ensure a newline at the end of the file.

## Specific Line Numbers and Code Snippets for Each Issue

### Major Issues
1. **Missing Tests for Edge Cases**
   - **File**: `src/tests/LoadingSpinner.test.js`
   - **Actionable Solution**: Add tests for the `LoadingSpinner` component that verify behavior with invalid props.
   ```javascript
   test('should not crash with invalid size prop', () => {
       const { getByRole } = render(<LoadingSpinner size="invalid" />);
       const spinner = getByRole('status');
       expect(spinner).toHaveClass('w-8 h-8'); // assuming medium is the default
   });
   ```

2. **Documentation Improvement**
   - **File**: `src/utils/formatCurrency.js`
   - **Actionable Solution**: Add JSDoc comments to explain functions.
   ```javascript
   /**
    * Formats a number as a currency string.
    * @param {number} amount - The amount of money to format.
    * @param {string} [currency='USD'] - The currency code to format the amount in.
    * @returns {string} The formatted currency string.
    */
   export const formatCurrency = (amount, currency = 'USD') => {...};
   ```

### Minor Issues
1. **Newline at End of File**
   - **Files**: `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner/LoadingSpinner.js`, `src/utils/formatCurrency.js`
   - **Actionable Solution**: Ensure a newline at the end of the file to comply with standard practices.

## Priority Order for Fixing Issues
1. **Enhance Documentation**: This will improve maintainability and clarity for future developers.
2. **Add Tests for Edge Cases**: Ensuring that the component handles unexpected inputs correctly is crucial for robustness.
3. **Fix Minor Code Style Issues**: While these do not impact functionality, they improve code readability and adherence to conventions.
