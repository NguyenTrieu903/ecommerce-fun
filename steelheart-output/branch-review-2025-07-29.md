### Code Review Decision: **PASS**

#### Summary
The code changes in branch **T2290725** introduce a `LoadingSpinner` component and enhance existing utilities without breaking existing functionality. No critical issues were identified during the review. However, some minor and major issues were noted that should be addressed to improve overall code quality and maintainability.

### Issues Identified

#### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES
- **None Found**: No security vulnerabilities, breaking changes, critical bugs, or production blockers were identified.

#### ðŸŸ¡ MAJOR ISSUES
1. **Missing Test Coverage for New Component**:
   - **Files Affected**: `src/components/common/LoadingSpinner/LoadingSpinner.js`
   - **Issue**: While there are tests for the `LoadingSpinner`, they could be more comprehensive, especially for testing edge cases such as rendering with invalid props.
   - **Actionable Solution**: Expand the test coverage to include tests for scenarios such as when props are not provided, and invalid sizes/colors are passed.
   - **Example**: Add tests for rendering without any props or with prop types that are not expected.

2. **Documentation**:
   - **Files Affected**: New files lack documentation.
   - **Issue**: While the LoadingSpinner and formatCurrency utilities are relatively straightforward, inline comments or a documentation file would improve maintainability.
   - **Actionable Solution**: Add JSDoc comments to the new components and utilities to describe their purpose and usage.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     /**
      * LoadingSpinner component that provides a visual loading indication.
      * @param {string} size - The size of the spinner ('small', 'medium', 'large').
      * @param {string} color - The color of the spinner ('blue', 'gray', 'white').
      */
     const LoadingSpinner = ({ size = 'medium', color = 'blue' }) => { ... }
     ```

#### ðŸ”µ MINOR ISSUES
1. **Code Style**:
   - **Files Affected**: Various
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent use of semicolons and spacing in some files.
   - **Actionable Solution**: Ensure consistent formatting across all new files. Using a linter (like ESLint) with a consistent configuration can help enforce style rules.
   - **Example**: Ensure that all lines consistently end with a semicolon where applicable.

2. **Performance Consideration**:
   - **Files Affected**: `src/utils/formatCurrency.js`
   - **Issue**: The use of `Intl.NumberFormat` is good, but consider caching instances of this formatter if used in performance-critical paths.
   - **Actionable Solution**: Create a cached formatter outside the function to avoid re-creating it for each call.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const currencyFormatter = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' });
     export const formatCurrency = (amount, currency = 'USD') => {
       return currencyFormatter.format(amount);
     };
     ```

### Priority Order for Fixing Issues
1. **Expand Test Coverage for the LoadingSpinner**: High priority, as comprehensive tests will ensure robustness.
2. **Add Documentation for New Files**: Medium priority, to improve maintainability.
3. **Consistent Code Style**: Medium priority, for better readability and maintenance.
4. **Performance Optimization in Currency Formatting**: Low priority, as itâ€™s a minor improvement that may not have immediate noticeable effects.

### Conclusion
The branch **T2290725** successfully introduces valuable features and improvements to the codebase without breaking existing functionality. With some attention to the issues identified, particularly regarding testing and documentation, this branch can enhance both user experience and code maintainability. The decision is to **PASS** the current changes with recommendations for improvement.
