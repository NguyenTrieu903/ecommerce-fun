## Code Review Summary

**Decision:** **PASS**

### Reasoning

Upon reviewing the changes made in the branch `T290725`, I found no critical issues that would block deployment. The new files added are well-structured, and the modifications made to existing files do not introduce breaking changes or critical bugs. However, there are a few areas that could be improved before the merge, primarily around code quality and documentation.

### Categorized Issues

#### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (FAIL if found)
- **None.**

#### ðŸŸ¡ Major Issues (should fix before merge)
1. **Missing Tests**
   - **Location:** New components and utility functions.
   - **Details:** The new `LoadingSpinner` component and `formatCurrency` utility function do not have accompanying unit tests. It is important to ensure that these new pieces of functionality are covered by tests to prevent regressions in the future.
   - **Actionable Solution:** Create unit tests for `LoadingSpinner` using a testing library like React Testing Library and for the `formatCurrency` utility. Example:
     ```javascript
     // src/components/common/LoadingSpinner/LoadingSpinner.test.js
     import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
     import LoadingSpinner from './LoadingSpinner';

     test('renders loading spinner with default props', () => {
       const { getByRole } = render(<LoadingSpinner />);
       expect(getByRole('status')).toBeInTheDocument();
     });
     ```

2. **Documentation**
   - **Location:** New files and modified functions.
   - **Details:** The new utility and component files lack documentation, which is crucial for maintainability and understanding.
   - **Actionable Solution:** Add comments and documentation to the new files explaining their purpose and usage. For example, in `formatCurrency.js`, you could add:
     ```javascript
     /**
      * Formats a number as currency.
      * @param {number} amount - The amount to format.
      * @param {string} currency - The currency code (default is 'USD').
      * @returns {string} - The formatted currency string.
      */
     ```

#### ðŸ”µ Minor Issues (can fix after merge)
1. **Code Style**
   - **Location:** General code aesthetics.
   - **Details:** The code is generally well-formatted, but a consistent approach to destructuring props (especially in `LoadingSpinner`) would enhance readability.
   - **Actionable Solution:** Consider destructuring props in one line for cleaner code, for example:
     ```javascript
     const LoadingSpinner = ({ size = 'medium', color = 'blue' }) => {
     ```

2. **Error Handling**
   - **Location:** `formatCurrency` function.
   - **Details:** The `formatCurrency` function does not handle cases where the `amount` is non-numeric.
   - **Actionable Solution:** Add validation to ensure `amount` is a number.
     ```javascript
     export const formatCurrency = (amount, currency = 'USD') => {
       if (typeof amount !== 'number') {
         throw new Error('Amount must be a number');
       }
       ...
     }
     ```

### Priority Order for Fixing Issues

1. **Missing Tests** - High priority; essential for ensuring reliability of new components and utilities.
2. **Documentation** - Medium priority; important for maintainability but can be addressed after tests.
3. **Code Style** - Low priority; while it can enhance readability, it does not impact functionality.
4. **Error Handling** - Medium priority; proper validation should be implemented to avoid runtime errors.

Overall, this branch introduces valuable components and utility functions while maintaining the existing functionality without critical issues. Addressing the highlighted areas will strengthen the codebase and further ensure stability in production.
